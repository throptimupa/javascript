## How to Capture Your Screen with Snagit

Once you have the capture window open, you can select the region of your screen that you want to capture. You can use the preset options, such as full screen, window, region, etc., or you can customize your own selection by dragging the crosshairs. You can also use the magnifier tool to zoom in and out of your screen for more accuracy.
 
After you have selected your capture area, you can click on the red Capture button to take a snapshot of your screen. Alternatively, you can press Enter or Spacebar on your keyboard. You can also use the timer option to delay your capture by a few seconds.
 
If you are capturing an image, Snagit will automatically open the Editor window, where you can edit and enhance your capture. If you are capturing a video, Snagit will start recording your screen and show you a small toolbar with some options, such as pause, stop, mute, etc.
 
## How to Record Your Screen with Snagit
 
If you want to record your screen and webcam at the same time, you need to enable the webcam option before you start your capture. You can do this by clicking on the webcam icon in the capture window and selecting your webcam device. You can also adjust the size and position of your webcam overlay by dragging it around.
 
When you are ready to record your screen and webcam, click on the Capture button or press Enter or Spacebar. Snagit will start recording your screen and show you a small toolbar with some options, such as pause, stop, mute, etc. You can also see a preview of your webcam in the corner of your screen.

You can preview your video by clicking on the Play button or pressing Spacebar. You can also trim your video by dragging the handles at the beginning and end of the timeline.
 
## How to Edit Your Captures with Snagit
 
Snagit has a powerful and intuitive Editor that lets you edit and enhance your captures. You can access the Editor by clicking on the Edit button in the capture window or by double-clicking on any capture in your library.
 
The Editor has three main sections: tools, properties, and canvas. The tools section has various options for editing your captures, such as crop, resize, rotate, annotate, add effects, etc. The properties section lets you adjust the settings of each tool, such as color, size, shape, etc. The canvas section shows your capture and lets you move and resize it.
 
To edit your capture, simply select a tool from the tools section and apply it to your capture in the canvas section. You can undo or redo any changes by clicking on the buttons at the top of the Editor window. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as Ctrl+Z for undo and Ctrl+C for copy.
